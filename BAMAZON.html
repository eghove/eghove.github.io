                        <p class="mb-30">BAMAZON is a text-based storefront simulator that can be accessed via the command line of a user's terminal. It was built using Node.js, JavaScript, mySQL, and several free, open-sourced Node modules. The BAMAZON simulator has two user-types: a BAMAZON customer and a BAMAZON manager.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-30">As a BAMAZON customer, the user can do the following: view a list of all items currently for sale on BAMAZON with a description, price, and item ID number; select an item to purchase by entering an item ID number; enter the quantity of the item to buy; automatically check if enough of the item is in stock to complete the order; see the total price of their order, and automatically update the inventory database with the appropriate quantity of the item remaining.</p>

                        <p class="mb-30">As a BAMAZON manager, the user can do the following: view a list of all items currently for sale on BAMAZON with a discription, price, item ID number, and quantity in stock; display a list of any inventory where the current quantity in stock is fewer than five items; add inventory to an existing item; and add a new item to the inventory database.</p>
