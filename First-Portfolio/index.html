            <!--Biographical information about me goes here-->
                <p>My name is Eric Hove, and I'm an aspiring web developer living in St. Paul, Minnesota. I'm currently enrolled in the Univeristy of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp. It's fast-paced and I've already learned a great deal.</p>
                <p>I live with my wife, Julie, and our two shy cats: Marcel and Beckett (yes, they're named after two famously reclusive writers). I've worked for the U.S. Government for nearly 10 years and am currently exploring a career change. I'm a graduate of Hamline University with a B.A. in Economics and a M.F.A. in Creative Writing. I'm the author of the poetry chapbook <i><a href="http://www.redbirdchapbooks.com/content/strange-friend">Strange Friend</a></i>, published by Red Bird Chapbooks (2015).</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing, walking, trips to Boundary Waters, adult beverages at The Nook and The Groveland Tap, and re-watching <i>Blade Runner</i> to fret about humanity's ethically confusing future. I also serve as Board Secretary for Academic Arts High School, a small charter school in West St. Paul.</p>
