# GIPHY-App
Welcome to my SPACE GIPHY app! 
This app is designed to make use of the GIPHY API to display 10 GIFs loosely related to space when buttons at the top of the web page are pressed.
The user can add their own button by using the submission field under "Add a space object!". GIFs load in their still state and when the user clicks on a GIF, it toggles to its animated state. If the moving GIF is clicked again, it resets to its still state.

Thanks for taking a look!
Eric
