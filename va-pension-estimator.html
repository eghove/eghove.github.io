                        <p class="mb-30">The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) administers an income-assistance program called Veterans Pension (or, in the case of dependents who survive a deceased veteran, Survivors Pension) about which many misperceptions exist. There are many income-related factors that determine the monthly Pension rate to which a veteran or veteranâ€™s surviving dependent may be entitled. Potential applicants may use this application to estimate their potential Pension rate.</p>

                        <p class="mb-30">This application is a full MERN application utilizing both Material UI for some styling and Auth0 for user authentication. The user can login, fill out a survey, and get an estimate for what they may be eligible for in terms of VA Pension before going through the somewhat long and complicated VA Pension application process.</p>

                        <p class="mb-30">Disclaimer: The VA Pension Estimator is not affiliated with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and is intended for educational purposes only. Any estimate displayed is unofficial and should not be construed as a promise of monetary benefits.</p>
